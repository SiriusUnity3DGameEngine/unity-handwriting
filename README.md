# unity-handwriting
EMNIST handwriting recognition for Unity using ML-Agents (https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents) and CNN model from https://github.com/Coopss/EMNIST

## Instructions
- Clone the repo. It's a Unity project with a sample scene.
- The repo includes a version of ML-Agents without examples. If you already have this installed in your own project, you might only want to copy scripts (and optionally prefabs) over.
